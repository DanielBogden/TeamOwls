<h1>Description and History</h1>
<p>Scala is an open source programming language which was developed in 2001 by a team of developers led by Martin Odersky at the Swiss Federal Institute.
It was launched on the market in 2003. Scala was an attempt to improve the already existing Java language. The language was developed to remove the restriction of Java, offering a cleaner and more well-organized language.</p>
<p>Scala is an object-oriented language. Object types and behaviors are described by classes and classes can be extended through subclasses</p>
<p>One of the attractive features of Scala is the  simple integration with Java. Scala is compiled into Java Byte Code which is executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) so it allows language interoperability between both. Therefore, you can reference libraries written in both languages, in both.</p>
<p>Scala also focused on adding features from other functional programming languages such as: optional parameters or anonymous functions.</p>
<h3> Opcional parameters </h3>
<div class="box1"><p>
Scala can set default values for parameters. Those parameters are optional in the function and we can call that method without providing a value for those parameters</p><pre><code>def printName(firstName: String, lastName: String, middleName : String = ""): Unit = {
  if (middleName.isEmpty)
    println(firstName + " " + lastName)
  else
    println(firstName + " " + middleName + " " + lastName)
}
printName("Jacob", "Ball")
printName("Michael", "Bott", "R")
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Anonymous function</h3>
<div class="box1">
<p>An anonymous function—also referred to as a lambda—is a block of code that’s passed as an argument to a higher-order function. For example, given a list like this:</p>
<pre><code>val ints = List(1,2,3,4,5)
//Create new list(2,4,6,8,10) using the map method
val doubledInts = ints.map((i: Int) => i * 2) 
//or in shorter form
val doubledInts = ints.map(_ * 2)  
//Create new list(1,2) using the filter method
val x = ints.filter(_ > 3)
</code></pre></div>
<p> Unlike Java, Scala does not support marked exceptions.
Scala doesn’t require that methods declare that exceptions can be thrown, and italso doesn’t require calling methods to catch them.</p>
<p> Nowadays there are many companies that use Scala as a programming language. Some examples are Linkedin, Twitter or Netflix.
These companies have stated that scala provides a more reliable and stable foundation for large projects.</p>
