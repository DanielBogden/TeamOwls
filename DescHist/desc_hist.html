<h1>Description and History</h1>
<p>Scala is an open source programming language which was developed in 2001 by a team of developers led by Martin Odersky at the Swiss Federal Institute.
Scala was an attempt to improve the already existing Java language. The language was developed to remove the restriction of Java, offering a cleaner and more well-organized language.</p>
<p>Scala is an object-oriented language. Object types and behaviors are described by classes and classes can be extended through subclasses</p>
<p>One of the attractive features of Scala is that it can be used to develop small scripts and transform them into large and sophisticated systems.</p>
<p>Scala is a language very similar to Java, the Scala source code is compiled into Java byte code. So it allows language interoperability with Java. Therefore, you can reference libraries written in both languages, in both.</p>
<p>However, unlike Java, Scala is also a functional programming language in the sense that every function is a value.</p>
<!---El lenguaje funcional te da funciones que hace que se parezca más a leer y escribir que a programar.--->
<p>Finally, Scala also allows functionalities such as operator overloading, raw strings, optional parameters, and named parameters. However, it does not support marked exceptions, as Java does.</p>
<p>In 2003 Scala was launched on the market.</p>
